    <h2>BackGround Information</h2>
    <p>For starters I am a french canadian boy who was born in montreal. I have 3 siblings, 1 older and the other 2 are younger. I speak fluent french and Im big on learning.
         I work as a lifeguard and swim teacher at The Wave.This job not only allows me to develop a strong sense of community and responsibility but also creates a good 
         skill with customer service and talking to people.Along with the oppurtunity this job came with was a great learning requirement. After being accepted as any 
         position in the waterpark you are trained to certify in Lifeguard Training, Oxygen , Emergency Response, CPR, AED, blood pathogen, all through Red Cross.
        (I am not AHA approved). 
    </p>
    <h2>Career Path and Goals</h2>
    <p>When I go into college I hope to attain a doctorates in math and a masters in physics, with those I hope to work for space exploration. For my future plan 
        I know Ill be able to accomplish big things and I hope to be considered as one of the smartest people alive. With this career path I hope to get into 
        The University of Toronto or Cambarage. My goal before retirement is to be able to pick up newtons work and either understand it or keep going with projects
        that he never got to finish.
    </p>
    <h2>Character</h2>
    <p>i like to describe myself in a simple way, Smart, hardworking, and Inovative. These traits make me a great fit for positions such as either the lowest or 
        the 2nd highest, being first is a big challenge for me as I dont like having everyone rely on my answers for their questions. When it comes to working in 
        the fields Im interested in, my traits would be most beneficial if I was to be in the low ranking staff with the ability to still do my own work.
