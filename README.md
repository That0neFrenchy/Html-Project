    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
        My biggest goal is to become a Physisist or Mathmetician for space exploration. I want to work at NASA or Space X in the future in hopes of becoming one of their elite memebers who is
        able to solve extremely complicated problems. For this I hope to go to a well known university and get a doctorates in math and a masters in physics. Math is one of my biggest interests 
        all I want to be able to do is apply my talent in math to help with technological advancements, hence the space exploration.
    </p>
    <h2>Character</h2>
    <p>i like to describe myself in a simple way, Smart, hardworking, and Inovative. These traits make me a great fit for positions such as either the lowest or 
        the 2nd highest, being first is a big challenge for me as I dont like having everyone rely on my answers for their questions. When it comes to working in 
        the fields Im interested in, my traits would be most beneficial if I was to be in the low ranking staff with the ability to still do my own work.
    </p>
    <h2>Important Achievements</h2>
    <p> I have few rare achievements but I take pride in the couple I do have. Since Juin of 2024 I have been a lifeguard with certifications from red cross. my certifications include; 
    CPR, Blood pathogens, Administering Oxygen, First Aid, and Lifeguard training certificate. (red cross approved, Not AHA). These certificates are symboles of my hard work and success, I 
    am proud to say that I have gotten these.</p>
   <div>
        <p>To conclude I am a hardworking teen looking to become a mathmetician/phtsisist in NASA. Thank you for reading bout me, I hope you have a blessed day.</p>
